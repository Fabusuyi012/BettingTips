	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Betting Over 0.5 goals on football</h2>
	<h3>This strategy allows you to earn a lot of money without a big risk to your bank.</h3>
	<hr>
	<p>We'll bet on Over 0,5 goals on a football
		<em>(soccer)</em> game. At least one goal has to be scored by one of the teams. Only a 0-0 draw destroys the winning sequence.</p>
	<p>If you choose your games carefully, you can easily get through 30 or 60 rounds in a row and that's what we're aiming for.</p>
	<div class="uk-alert" style="text-align: center;">The system is progressive. You have to bet all-in in every round.</div>
	<p>The system is played on the betting exchange on 
		<em>in-play games</em> - during the game. You could also use any other bookmaker that offers live betting, but you'll get better prices on the exchange.</p>
	<hr>
	<ul>
	
	<li><p>
		Set a stake to start with. 2€, 5€ or 10€ will be enough.</p></li>
	<li><p>
		Find a game which you're confident will not end with a 0-0 draw.</p></li>
	<li><p>
		choose the
		<strong>Over 0.5 goals</strong> market, or
		<strong>Total Goals</strong> market.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Sometimes, the Over/under 0.5 goals market has more money available than the Total goals market and vice versa. Check them both out if you're playing on a betting exchange. The Over/Under market pays out winnings within minutes after a goal is scored, while on Total Goals Market the game needs to end before the winnings are paid out. You decide which one you'll use, both mean the same - at least one goal in the game.</p>
	
	<p>This is the option you're looking for -
		<strong>1 goal or more.</strong> As you can see - at the moment, there is not much activity, only 77Gbp available to bet on, but this brings us to our next important point:</p>
	<div class="uk-alert" style="text-align: center;">DO NOT PLACE BETS BEFORE THE GAME. WAIT FOR THE GAME TO START! IT HAS TO BE AN IN-PLAY GAME, WHERE YOU CAN PLACE BETS LIVE DURING THE GAME!</div>
	<p>Now you have several options when to place the bet:</p>
	<p>
		If you're expecting an early goal - you want to place your bet as soon as the game starts.</p>
	<p>Our tip - the odds for Over 1 goal should be at least 1.11! Do not place bets before that. If an early goal surprises you simply move on to the next game. You have to keep in mind that the exchange also takes 5% commission of your winnings, so wait for 1.11
		<em>(at least)</em>. You really shouldn't place anything below that.</p>
	<p>
		You could wait up to 30 minutes.</p>
	<p>Statistically first goals are scored around this time. This will increase your prices even further.</p>
	<p>
		Wait for the first half to end without goals and place the bet during halftime.</p>
	<p>This will boost the odds above 1,20 and increase the winnings. This is the recommended option for betting on Over 0.5 goals.</p>
	<p>You decide what works best for you!</p>
	<hr>
	<h4 style="text-align: center;">
		Let's take a look how much you can win using this strategy with a 10€ stake.</h4>
	<p style="text-align: center;">If you placed your bets at estimated odds of 1.10, 30 consecutive wins will multiply your stake 17 times:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		<strong>10€ x 17 = 170€!</strong>
	</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">If you placed your bets at around 1.20, 30 consecutive wins will multiply your stake 237 times:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;">
		<strong>10€ x 237 = 2.370€!</strong>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>It's worth taking a look at <strong>"over 0,5 goals"</strong> betting strategy. And don't forget - play on a betting exchange and take advantage of higher prices and bigger market liquidity.</p>
